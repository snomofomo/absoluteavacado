# Total.js/Postgresql Demo

- update user:password in config

- npm install and node index.js to run

- basic listing at http://localhost:8000/  (see controllers/default.js)

- api identical to express tutorial (see controllers/api.js)

I did NO data validation/sanitation,  this is just to demonstrate Postgresql actions in total.

See package.json for deps
